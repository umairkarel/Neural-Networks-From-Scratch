# Neural Networks From Scartch

## Implementing a Neural Network From Complete Scratch

here i've implemented a neural network without using any ml-library
and just python Classes.

### Basics Overview of the Network.
* The network class takes in the 3 inputs as no. of input nodes, hidden nodes and  output nodes.
* The Model uses **Sigmoid Activation Function** for neuron activation.
* **Gardient Descent** is used for Optimization.

____

Here, the version1 program uses only one hidden layer, But in version2 i've improved the code so that you can add **n hidden layers** to the network.

### What you can do using this simple neural network?
here are some projects i've implemented using this simple neural network

* [Color Predictor](https://github.com/umairkarel/Machine-Learning/tree/master/Color_Predictor)
* [Hand Written Digit Recognizer](https://github.com/umairkarel/Machine-Learning/tree/master/Hand-Written-Digit-Recognizer)
